# Swipe-to-Delete Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of swipe-to-delete functionality for both list items and saved lists in the shopping list application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `useSwipeToDelete` Hook
- **Location**: `src/App.tsx` (lines 13-118)
- **Purpose**: Reusable hook that handles swipe gesture detection and deletion
- **Features**:
  - Detects right-swipe gestures (horizontal movement)
  - Prevents activation on vertical scrolling
  - 35% width threshold for delete trigger
  - Smooth CSS transitions for slide and fade effects
  - Prevents click events when swiping

### 2. Updated Row Component
- **Changes**:
  - Removed delete button (`✖`) in edit mode
  - Added swipe-to-delete wrapper structure
  - Red background bar with trash icon (only visible in non-edit mode)
  - Sliding animation on swipe
  - Fade-out animation on delete
- **Behavior**:
  - Only enabled in non-edit mode
  - Swipe right to reveal red bar
  - Swipe 35% of width to trigger delete
  - Release before threshold returns item to position

### 3. Created SavedListItem Component  
- **Location**: `src/App.tsx` (lines 1494-1556)
- **Purpose**: Displays saved lists with swipe-to-delete
- **Features**:
  - Same swipe behavior as list items
  - Red bar with trash icon background
  - Removed two-stage delete button

### 4. Removed Old Delete Mechanisms
- Removed `✖` delete button from list items in edit mode
- Removed two-stage delete (arm/confirm) for saved lists
- Removed related state: `deleteArmedId`, `deleteTimerRef`, `armDelete`, `doDelete`

## Technical Details

### Swipe Detection
```typescript
const SWIPE_THRESHOLD = 0.35; // 35% of width
const SWIPE_START_PX = 8;     // Minimum movement to start swipe
```

### Animation Specs
- **Slide duration**: 0.2s (ease-out) during swipe return
- **Delete slide**: 0.15s (ease-out)
- **Fade-out**: 0.1s (ease-out)
- **No transition** while actively swiping (smooth follow)

### Gesture Handling
1. `onPointerDown`: Capture start position
2. `onPointerMove`: Track horizontal movement, show red bar
3. `onPointerUp`: Check threshold and delete or return
4. Vertical movement cancels swipe gesture

### UI Elements

#### Red Bar (Background)
- Color: `#ef4444` (red)
- Static position (doesn't move)
- Contains white trash icon
- Only rendered in non-edit mode for list items

#### Sliding Content
- Transforms via `translateX`
- Smooth CSS transitions
- Opacity fade on delete
- Prevents click when swiping detected

## User Experience

### List Items (Non-Edit Mode)
1. User swipes item to the right
2. Red bar with trash icon appears on left
3. Item slides right revealing the bar
4. At 35% width → delete triggers automatically
5. Item slides out and fades away
6. If released before threshold → returns smoothly

### Saved Lists (Storage Box Modal)
- Same behavior as list items
- Swipe right to delete
- No confirmation dialog needed
- Immediate feedback

### Edit Mode
- Swipe-to-delete is **disabled** in edit mode
- Users can still use drag handles for reordering
- Checkbox selection still works

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Swipe right on list item reveals red bar
- [x] Swipe 35%+ triggers delete
- [x] Swipe less than 35% returns item
- [x] Click still toggles checkbox (no swipe)
- [x] Vertical scroll doesn't trigger swipe
- [x] Saved list items can be swiped to delete
- [x] No delete button visible in edit mode
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors

### Browser Compatibility
- Supports both touch and mouse input
- Uses PointerEvent API for unified handling
- CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Works on mobile and desktop browsers

## Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx`: Main implementation
- `.gitignore`: Added build and screenshots directories
